# QA-benchmark-polymers

Experimentation stage... 

QA dataset for benchmarking LLMs with respect to their abilities to answer polymer science questions.

Current approach:
1. Generate QA (multiple choice) pairs from pre-selected literature
2. Polymer expert review of the questions
3. Testing mid-size open reasoning LLMs on the benchmark

Current conclusion:
It is too easy. The alternative answers are usually too obviously wrong.
